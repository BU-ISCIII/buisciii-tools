- `tbprofiler.variants.csv` – Combined variant-level data across all samples.  
  * *sample*: Sample identifier.
  * *gene_name*: Name of the gene where a variant was detected.
  * *change*: Specific nucleotide or amino acid change observed in the gene.
  * *freq*: Frequency of the variant in the sequencing data (e.g., allele fraction).
  * *type*: Type of variant (e.g., SNP, insertion, deletion).
  * *drugs*: Drugs potentially affected by the variant or associated resistance.

- `tbprofiler.variants.txt` – Variant summary, where each column represents a mutation per gene and each row represents a sample.
  * *Rv1819c_c.X>Y*: Specific nucleotide variant in the Rv1819c gene (c. = coding DNA sequence; e.g., c.102G>A = G at position 102 changed to A).  
  * *Rv1819c_p.AAA###BBB*: Specific protein change in the Rv1819c gene (p. = protein; e.g., p.Ala152Val = alanine at position 152 changed to valine).  
  * *Rv0678_p.Gln22Pro*: Specific protein change in the Rv0678 gene.
