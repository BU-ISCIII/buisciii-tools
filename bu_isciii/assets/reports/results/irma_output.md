# IRMA-output

This markdown briefly describes the files found in `RESULTS/` folder for IRMA services. As described [here]()

## **`krona_results.html`** 

Includes the multiQC html report from MAG, you can find a further description in [MAG](https://github.com/BU-ISCIII/buisciii-tools/blob/main/bu_isciii/assets/reports/md/mag.md).

## Files in `fragment_name/`

Depending on the virus types found in your samples, you will have one folder for each fragment found (e.g. A_H1 for Influenza A H1_N1). In these folders you will have a multi-fasta file for each of the fragments found, which will include all the sequences for that specific fragment found by IRMA in the samples. Here's an example:
```
A_H1/A_HA.txt
>Sample1_HA
XXXXXXXX-SEQUENCE_OF_FRAGMENT_HA_FOR_SAMPLE1-XXXXXXXX
>Sample2_HA
XXXXXXXX-SEQUENCE_OF_FRAGMENT_HA_FOR_SAMPLE2-XXXXXXXX
>Sample3_HA
XXXXXXXX-SEQUENCE_OF_FRAGMENT_HA_FOR_SAMPLE3-XXXXXXXX
```

## **`all_samples_completo.txt`** 

This file is a multi-fasta that includes all the assembly sequences generated by IRMA for all the fragments found in all the samples. The structure content of this file is the same as the previously described.

In case of Influenza services (FLU), you will find a file named `flu_type_summary.txt`, which will include a summary of the different types of influenza found in your samples. This is the most relevant information to be included in your report.
