## MAG

Here we describe the results from the MAG pipeline for multispecies metagenomic analysis.

### MAG - TAXONIMIC ANALYSIS

### MAG - COMPLETE ANALYSIS

* `mag_all/krona/${sample_name}.${tool}.report.html`: A Krona interactive visualization report for the each sample based on Kraken2 (or other) taxonomic classification mehtod.
* `mag_all/quast/${sample_name}.${tool}.report.html`: A Quast report for the assembly quality control of each sample assembled using MEGAHIT, SPAdes or other.
* `mag_all/multiqc_report.html`: A combined report generated by MultiQC summarizing various quality control results for all samples.

## Taxprofiler

Here we describe the results from the (nf-core/taxprofiler)[https://nf-co.re/taxprofiler/1.1.8] pipeline for multispecies taxonomic classification and profiling of shorgun short- and long-read.

* `taxprofiler/multiqc_report.html​`: Final HTML report collecting numerical stats from each module executed in this pipeline.
* `taxprofiler/krona/database_*.html`: Interactive HTML files generated by Krona, displaying the results of taxonomic classification for supported tools (Kraken2, Centrifuge, Kaiju, and MALT)
